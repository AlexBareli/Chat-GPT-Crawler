## What is it?

Tunnel is chatbot that uses GPT technology to help people easily find information that's
on the University of San Francisco webpage without manually having to search the entire 
webpage. The chatbot crawls the webpage and yield's a response based on what was found.

## How did the hackathon go?

I think we'd collectively say that it went pretty well. Although we didn't win, we learned
a lot throughout the process and were happy that we had a functional and working program
(even though it suffered from inaccuracy).

## FAQ

**&rarr; What can I expect to learn from it?**

To make Tunnel, we've utilized the following tools and tech stack:
 - Figma (check out the file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/xOPy5vflm3wWnEdMFbRXqf/Chat-GPT-%40-USF?node-id=2%3A8&t=tsQ3i4dOA5rryARj-1))
 - HTML/CSS
 - Python
 - Flask
 
 **&rarr; What's its current state? What're the plan?**
 
 As of `March 3, 2023`, we plan to continue working on it, but is still in the same
 state as it was upon hackathon completion.
 
> It currently can answer both USF and non-USF related questions which is not what we
  want. We hope to limit its scope by implementing a separate web page crawler.
> Some questions asked yield ridiculously wrong answers, which we also believe
  come from the non-implementation of an outside crawler.
